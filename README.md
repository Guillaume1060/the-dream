# The dream üçπ

- Repository: `the-dream`
- Type of Challenge: `Learning`
- Duration: `1 day`
- Team challenge : `solo`

#### üå± Mission

- Pick your next travel destination and check the exchange rate: local currency / Euros.
- Make a small webpage where you can enter the local rate (use a form), and it'll tell you the price in Euros. A simple calculation will do, no need to get updated rates from external API's.
- Use a form that submits to PHP (no JS allowed / no preventDefault)

## Result

- A simple interface (see below) but functionnal.
- Need update to automatically show the localCurrency when selecting countries.
